# URL Shortener

## Objective 
Your assignment is to implement a URL shortening service.

## Brief
ShortLink is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://yello.co/directory1/directory2/resource and it returns a short URL such  as https://short.est/GeAi9K.

## Tasks 
- Implement assignment using: 
  - Language: Python or NodeJS
  - Framework: Your choice, Django or ExpressJS would both be options.
- Two endpoints are required:
  1. /encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL
  2. /decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL. 
- Both endpoints should return JSON response.
- There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to make sure that a URL can be encoded to a short URL and the short URL can be decoded to the original URL. You can persist the short URLs and  Long URLs in a database, but you don't have to.

## Evaluation Criteria 
- Coding Language best practices
- API implemented featuring a /encode and /decode endpoint
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are we able to demonstrate that?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
It doesnâ€™t have to be perfect. Writing code always involves trade-offs and design decisions. The most important thing is your ability to speak about the decisions you have made.

## Submission Process:
- Please submit your code in a new Github repository. You can start by forking this repository into your own account and then create a clone of that locally.
